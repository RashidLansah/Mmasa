# 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED

## The Fix Is Complete! ✅

I've successfully updated your app to use the Firebase JS SDK which is compatible with Expo.

## What Was Fixed:

1. ✅ Removed React Native Firebase packages (incompatible with Expo)
2. ✅ Installed Firebase JS SDK (Expo-compatible)
3. ✅ Updated all service files to use new SDK
4. ✅ Updated auth context
5. ✅ Cleaned up configuration files
6. ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

## 🚀 Next Step: Restart the App

### In your terminal where npm start is running:

1. **Press `Ctrl + C`** to stop the current process
2. **Run:** 
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Press `i`** for iOS or **`a`** for Android

The error should be gone! ✨

## Expected Behavior:

When you restart:
- ✅ No "Native module RNFBAppModule not found" error
- ✅ App loads successfully
- ✅ You'll see the onboarding screen
- ✅ You can navigate to login/signup

## Test the App:

1. Skip onboarding
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Create an account
4. You should be logged in!

## If You Still See Errors:

Try clearing the cache:
```bash
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
expo start -c
```
